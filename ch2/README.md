publish the messages locally.

2) Launch the server as shown in [akkademy-db-server](akkademy-db/README.md).  The output 
should show that an Actor has been created.

3) Run the client tests as shown in [akkademy-db-client](akkademy-db-client/README.md)
within a separate terminal.  All the tests should succeed.
