Chapter 2:  Actors and Concurrency

***

Instructions for running AkkademyDB:

1) Follow the instructions in [akkademy-db-messages](akkademy-db-messages/README.md) to
publish the message library locally.

2) Launch the server as shown in [akkademy-db](akkademy-db/README.md) in its own terminal.
The output should show that an Actor has been created.

3) Run the client tests as shown in [akkademy-db-client](akkademy-db-client/README.md) in
a separate terminal.  All the tests should succeed.

Troubleshooting ideas can be found in [akkademy-db-client](akkademy-db-client/README.md).
